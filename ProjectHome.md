Java Specifications In Z Language Extension (JSIZzLE) is a derivation of the Java language that allows the specification of software behaviour at an abstract level. JSizzle specifications:
  * Are easy for Java programmers to create and understand
  * Make use of existing Java tools such as development environments
  * Can be used to instrument executable code with assertion checking
  * Make minimal use of Java annotations
  * Are based on the Z notation, and could be converted to (and from) Z for formal analysis
The point is to create a simple, achievable incursion of formal methods into new areas of mainstream software engineering by leaning heavily on familiarity of syntax and tools.

> "_... a genuinely promising new idea. Two problems which have always been associated with formal methods are the apparent unfamiliarity of mathematical notations such as Z and the lack of tools to support the development of large specifications. Your approach tackles both of these by providing an equivalent notation in the form of "pseudoJava" which is well defined and at the same time exploits the huge investment in Java development tools. If carried through to its logical conclusion as an explicit bridge between Z and Java, your technique could potentially make it attractive to use Z in a much wider range of development projects, beyond its current rather narrow application in high value safety critical systems._"
